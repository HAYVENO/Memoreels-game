<a href="https://memoreels-x.vercel.app/"  target="_blank" >Memoreels</a> is a fun, simple, but addictive **cross-platform** memory game that challenges your retention aptitude and reflexes. Memoreels is simple - yet challenging, and it's perfect for improving your cognitive abilities.

## Main Skills Showcased

Memoreels is one of my first projects. Initially built for a JS logic challenge to test my skills in Javascript, I went ahead to improve on the logic and UI.

**A. Vanilla JavaScript:** The game is programmed entirely with vanilla JavaScript, without the use of any external frameworks or libraries. This demonstrates my ability to work with the core features of the language and write efficient code.

**B. Game Logic:** I implemented the game logic using loops and functions, with each button having its unique ID and sound. This enables the game to scale and adapt to various screen sizes and device types.

**C. User Interface Design:** Memoreels is also intended to showcase an eye for creating simple, visually appealing **responsive design**. The game has a clean and modern look and feel, with a colour scheme that's easy on the eyes.

## Cloning or Forking the App

If you would like to use Memoreels as a starting point for your own project, you can clone or fork the app from the GitHub repository â€” don't forget to leave a star ðŸŒŸ.

To clone the app and access it from your machine, run the following command in your terminal:

#Open the game locally with Live Server to start the game in `http://127.0.0.1:5500/` or any other specified port.
```

## How to Play Memoreels

Memoreels game consists of a grid of buttons that light up and produce a unique sound. Your goal is to memorize the sequence of the buttons and sounds and repeat them back in the correct order.

The game starts with a single button, and the sequence increases in length with each successful round. If you make a mistake, itâ€™s game over, and you restart.
